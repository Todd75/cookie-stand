      <p id="chinook">This is a Wild Pacific Chinook Salmon and the beautiful fish that inspired our amazing cookies.
        These amazing fish spend most of their life in the ocean and then migrate back to the rivers they were born in
        to spawn. The Yukon river has the longest freshwater route of any salmon with an over 1900 mile swim upstream
        from the Bering Sea to the Whitehorse spawning grounds. </p>
